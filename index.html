              <p>
                  A data scientist collects, analyzes, and interprets large volumes of data,
                  in many cases. Data scientist professionalsdevelop statistical models that
                  analyze data and detect patterns, trends, and relationships in data sets.
                  This information can be used to predict consumerbehavior or to identify
                  business and operational risks. The data scientist isoften a storyteller
                  presenting data insights to decision makers in a way that
                  is understandable and applicable to problem-solving.

                  executing the software project. Software project manager is aware
                  of all the phases of SDLC that the software would go through. Project manager
                  may never directly involve in producing the end product but he controls and
                  manages the activities involved in production.

                  executes various plans, arranges necessary and maintains communication
                  among all team members.
